    "- Building a model is probably not the end goal.\n",

    "**How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model?**\n",
    "- This is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, - what algorithms you will select, \n",
    "- what performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and \n",
    "- how much effort you should spend tweaking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does the current solution looks like (if any)?**\n",
    "- It will often give you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design your system and frame the problem**\n",
    "- is it supervised, unsupervised or Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "- Is it a classification task, a regressing task, or something else?\n",
    "- Should you use batch learning or online learning techniques?\n",

    "3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.\n",
    "4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "5. Select a model and train it.\n",
    "6. Fine-tune your model.\n",
    "7. Present your solution.\n",
    "8. Launch, monitor and maintain your system."
